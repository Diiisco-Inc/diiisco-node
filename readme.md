Diiisco is a globally distributed network of machines running large language models. Send a prompt to any node on the Diiisco network and our shared compute will get you a response from the model of your choice. If you have a laptop, a desktop or a super computer you can join the Diiisco network, contribute your compute and get rewarded in USDC on Algorand - it's fast, efficient and getter than paying $25 a month! 

## Join the Network

Joining the network is easy, all you need is a computer and a locally running Large language Model (LLM). The best way to get started with this is with a tool like Ollama. Head to https://ollama.com and download the application. then downlaod a model. We recommend small models for laptops, medium for desktop PCs and larger models for gaming PCs are equipment with dedicated GPUs.

Then download this repo and run using Node.JS
